TO DO
#####




Content
-------

- Trouble with remove_ship_time() in jupyter notebooks -> figure doesn't show. 
  
  - Is this solved by calling *%matplotlib*?

- Missing mask_surf_sidelobe() (should calculate based on beam angle, but not 
  sure where to find that).

- Needs some reorganization - new stuff is a bit all over the place.




#### STATUS 09.3.22

- Made functionality for exporting to netCDF.
  - Need to do soem final tweaks to make it completely CF-compatible.

- Made a bunch of diagnostics plot functions that should be reasonably robust:

  - xy plot of uv, with variance ellipses etc.
  - uv panel/profile plots
  - histograms

- Corrected a previous error in uv-rotation.

Figures out that jupyter notebook plots seem to be ok if %matplotlib is 
called - no idea why.




Testing
-------

I've only done ad hoc testing as I added functionality. Need to do some more
extensive testing on different datasets and different routines.

Also need to do more extensive testing to ensure compatibility across platforms and 
python3 versions. Should look into *pytest* etc.

Need to check correct_magdec()
- Check that the rotation is the right way, etc.
- Check compatability with both constant and time-varying lon, lat.
    - Option to interpolate in the set_latlon() method?

Should include some nice-looking tests eventually.

Documentation
-------------

Needs a proper documentation. Function docstrings are pretty decent, and rdi_adcp.example()
should be ok -> can use these as a starting point.

Should probably make a walkthough tutorial - probably in the form of a static notebook. 

Update dependencies (do standard libraries go in setup.py?) - pkgutils etc

Maybe look into sphinx documentation? I think there must be some way of automatic doc generation.

Needs something for non-python users (probably a reference to some other documentation.)

Make sure the git page looks ok.

Get other people to test once I have done some more checks myself.


Organization etc
-----------------

Need to look at how things are organized after recent changes. Esp the plotting 
functions and netcdf stuff.

Need to go through and check the formatting etc to make sure the code is fairly PEP8.

Introduce line breaks (80L) in variables_dictionary.py

Should probably make variables_dictionary into a "data file" to load (as per 
https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-package-data point 2.7).
Haven't really looked into this yet. 

Should look into whether library imports should be done in __init__.py instead
of in the rdi_adcp.py. Would be cleaner anyways.

Publishing
----------

Look into license issues (should be ok since this is non-commercial?)

Eventually want to publish in pip library - could also look into conda, but that 
seems more complicated.

  - How does uploading to pip work? Can updates be pushed there?
  - Can documentation on github or elsewhere be referred to from a *pip* page?
